  <Function>Provides a C++ class library of cryptographic schemes including encryption functions, hashing functions, cryptographically secure RNG's, and other helper classes to support encryption and hashing</Function>
  <Justification>It allows us to use industry standard encryption and hashing functions that have been thoroughly tested for security issues. Implementing these functions ourselves may result in errors that could make the systems vulnerable to attacks.</Justification>

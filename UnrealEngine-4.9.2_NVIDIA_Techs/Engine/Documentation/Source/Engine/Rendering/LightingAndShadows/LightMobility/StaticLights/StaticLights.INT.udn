The primary use case for static lights is for low power devices on mobile platforms.

## Light Source Radius

As mentioned above, **Light Source Radius** for Static Lights have the additional effect of softening the shadows they cast, much in the same way area lights work in many 3D rendering packages. Below, the light on the _left_ has a small Light Source Radius and casts sharper shadows. The light on the _right_ has a larger Light Source Radius and so casts softer shadows.

## Lightmap Resolution

**Lightmap Resolution** allows you to control the detail of the baked lighting that static lights produce.

<!-- Long Description Excerpt
[EXCERPT:Static001]
Static light cast completely static light and shadows. What this means is their effect gets baked down in **Lightmass** to light maps and into the indirect lighting cache. **Static lights have no direct affect on movable/dynamic actors nor do the create any specular highlights on any objects**, but since they will bake into the indirect lighting cache, they will have some _minor_ indirect effect on movable/dynamic objects.

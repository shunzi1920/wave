Actor Locking allows for the perspective Viewport camera to be used as a placement mechanism for Actors within your levels. Simply lock to a given Actor, position the view where you want that Actor to be placed, and then unlock. The position and orientation of the camera will be used to position the given Actor.

## Locking the Viewport to an Actor

To lock the view to an Actor, click the Actor Locking option in the Viewport Options menu, which is located in the upper-left corner of the Viewport.

Locking is especially useful for Camera Actors and Lights. As such, all cameras and lights will be immediately available in the sub-menu for Actor Locking. However, locking also works with any selected Actor. With an Actor selected, you will see it available in the Actor Locking sub-menu.

While locking is active, you will see a padlock icon in the upper left of the Viewport. This indicates that you have some Actor attached to the view.

Once locked, you will look down the X-Axis of the given object. You may then move the view as normal and the Actor will come along automatically.

Once you are finished positioning the Actor by way of the view, you can unlock it by choosing the Unlock option in the Actor Locking sub-menu:

You can now continue working and the Actor will maintain the position previously set by the view.

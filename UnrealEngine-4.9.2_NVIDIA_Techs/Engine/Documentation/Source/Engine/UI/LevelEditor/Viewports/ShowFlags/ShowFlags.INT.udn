[TOC(start:2 end:2)]




The Show Flags are found under the Viewport **Show** menu. They are a means by which you can show and hide many of the items that are viewed within the viewport. For example, you can hide all particles, all landscape objects, or something a bit more advanced like turning off all of the sprite icons.

|Lighting Components||
|---|---|
|[REGION:tablesection]Name[/REGION]|[REGION:tablesection]Description[/REGION]|
|**Ambient Cubemap**|Shows/hides the result of the ambient cubemap.|

## Developer

|Developer||
|---|---|
|[REGION:tablesection]Name[/REGION]|[REGION:tablesection]Description[/REGION]|
|**AI Debug**|This shows the paths an AI-driven pawn is using to navigate along a Nav Mesh.|
|**Blur GBuffer**|Shows/hides the results of Blue GBuffer Intensity, a property found on Post Process Volumes. This feature blurs the GBuffer normals and adjusts the GBuffer roughness to reduce specular aliasing. It is, however, a high performance cost for the result and you should generally consider just using Temporal AA.  |
|**GBuffer Hints (material attributes)**|Colorizes objects that have improper Materials. Yellow for objects that are impossibly non-reflective, red for objects that emit more light than they receive.|
|**Hit Proxies**|Shows/hides the proxy shapes used by hit detection.|
|**Log Visualizer**|Draws any data to the screen that is required by the Log Visualizer system.|
|**On Screen Debug**|This is to hide things like VisualizeTexture or stats printout. |
|**Refraction**|Shows/hides the results of refraction on Materials.|
|**Shadows of Editor-Hidden Actors**|Shows dynamic shadows for objects that are hidden in the editor, such as those hidden by pressing the **H** key.|
|**Test Image**|Shows a test image for configuration of monitor and graphics settings.|
|**Vector Fields**|Shows/hides any vector fields in the scene.|


## Visualize

|Visualize||
|---|---|
|[REGION:tablesection]Name[/REGION]|[REGION:tablesection]Description[/REGION]|
|**Adaptive Depth of Field**|Applies a color coding filter to the view such that objects that are blurred by Depth of Field are tinted green and only the area in focus receives its normal color.|
|**Depth of Field Layers**|Applies a color coding filter to the view such that objects blurred by near DOF are green, objects blurred by far DOF are blue. Objects in focus appear black. |
|**HDR**|Shows a visualization window that expresses the scene histogram, as well as how exposure settings are affecting brightness. |
|**Motion Blur**|When Motion Blur is on, this changes the view to a Motion Blur visualizer, allowing you to see the motion vectors being used to calculate blur.|
| [**Out of Bounds Pixels**](Engine/Performance/Visualizers/OutOfBoundsPixels) | If a pixel of an object exists outside that object's bounding volume, it can lead to flickering or the object disapearing when the bounding volume (but not the mesh) is off camera. This visualizer colorizes those pixels in blue, yellow, and white. |

[REGION:note]
Billboard sprites are generally in-editor icons used for placement of various object types. In this case, they do not refer to sprite particles.

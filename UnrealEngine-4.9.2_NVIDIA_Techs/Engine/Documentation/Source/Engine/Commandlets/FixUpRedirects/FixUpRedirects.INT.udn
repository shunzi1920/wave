## Overview

Makes certain that there are no redirectors causing content to be loaded when it should not be. 



## Detailed Motivation

Someone has checked in material into an always loaded package that should not be there.  In the **Content Browser**, you move the Material to a new location.  Doing so will leave a redirector so that objects pointing to the previous Material will know where the new location is.  The redirector will cause that content to be loaded until fixupredirects can be run.



## Operation

To run this commandlet, from a command prompt window, navigate to the _UnrealEngine3\Binaries_ directory.


### Syntax

The syntax is as follows:

    [GameName].exe fixupredirects
    

## How to use / turn on

Just run GAMENAME FixUpRedirects.


NOTE:  if you have more than one game you will want to do the following method:


* run the commandlet on each of your games one at a time.
* revert any changes to engine content after each game is run except the last one.
* check in all the changed content.


This will ensure that each game is correctly updated with the new location of Engine Content.

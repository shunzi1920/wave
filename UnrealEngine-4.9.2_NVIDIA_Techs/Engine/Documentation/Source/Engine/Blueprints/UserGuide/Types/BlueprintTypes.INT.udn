Title: Types of Blueprints
Crumbs: %ROOT%, Engine/Blueprints
Description:Landing page for information on different types of Blueprints.


Sometimes it is difficult to tell which type of **Blueprint** you should use at first glance, especially 
when it comes to **Blueprint Macro Libraries** and **Blueprint Classes**. A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself:

* _Are there multiple instances?_

If you will have more than one or two instances (e.g., a TV set that can be shot or turned on/off), 
then it probably makes sense to create a **Blueprint Class**, with associated code living there. 
If not, and you just want to have some helper functions (like find all Actors within X units), those 
are ideal to live in a **Blueprint Macro Library**.

		A **Blueprint Utility**, a.k.a. a **Blutility**, is an editor-only _Blueprint_ that can be used to perform editor actions or extend 
		editor functionality. These can expose [](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Events) with no parameters as buttons in the UI 
		and have the ability to execute any functions exposed to _Blueprints_ and act on the current set of selected Actors in the viewport.

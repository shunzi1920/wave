Description:Guide to opening Blueprint Classes for editing from the Content Browser and the Level Editor

You can open a _Blueprint Class_ in the **Blueprint Editor** either by interacting with the asset directly in the **Content Browser**, or by interacting with an
instance of the _Blueprint Class_ that has been placed in your level.

## Content Browser
* **Double-click** on the icon in the **Content Browser**.

[REGION:warning]
Although these two methods involve menus attached to an individual instance of a _Blueprint_, please note that any changes made in the **Blueprint Editor** are made to the _Blueprint_ asset. 
As a result, the changes will be applied to all instances of the _Blueprint_.

[EXCERPT:GraphIntro]
A **Graph** is a network of nodes that can be connected to one another in order to define the flow of execution for the network. Graphs are the basis for implementing functionality in Blueprints. 
Each Blueprint can contain one or more graphs, depending on the type of Blueprint, that define the implementation of a particular aspect of the Blueprint. Each graph within a Blueprint can also 
contain sub-graphs, which are essentially collections of nodes collapsed into their own separate graph, mainly for organizational purposes. There are specialized types of Graphs that have unique 
properties, but the key principles of adding variable references, adding and connecting Nodes, and debugging will apply throughout.

		**EventGraphs** are the most general type of _Blueprint_ graph.  Each new _Blueprint Class_ will contain one **EventGraph** when it is created, although more can be added.  These additional **EventGraphs** can
help to organize your _Blueprint_ networks.  **EventGraphs** generally contain the networks for the gameplay behavior of the _Blueprint_, with [**Events**](Engine/Blueprints\UserGuide\Events), 
[**CustomEvents**](Engine/Blueprints\UserGuide\Events\Custom), and **Input** nodes serving to initiate the flow of execution through the **EventGraph**.

		**ConstructionScripts** are unique to _Blueprint Classes_, with only one **ConstructionScript** graph present in each _Blueprint Class_.  **ConstructionScripts** are useful for _Blueprint Class_ initialization,
as they run right after the **Components** list is set up for the _Blueprint Class_.

## Working with Graphs

Whether your _Graph_ is a _Construction Script_, _EventGraph_, _Function_, or _Macro_, you will edit it in the [Graph](Engine/Blueprints\Editor\Modes\GraphPanel) mode of the [](Engine/Blueprints\Editor). Fundamentally,
all _Graphs_ contain networks of _Nodes_ connected by _Wires_.

The **Class Defaults** tab contains the following sections:

| Item | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Default** | Lists any variables and their values if you do not specify a different category than **Default** when you create them. Note that you must compile the Blueprint in order to display its variables on the **Class Defaults** tab. |
| **Rendering** | Contains information about properties related to how (and whether) an Actor based on the Blueprint is rendered in the game. |
| **Replication** | Contains information about properties that dictate how your Actor behaves in a networked game, such as its network priority and relevancy to other clients. |
| **Input** | Contains information about how Actors based on this Blueprint respond to input. |
| **Actor** | Contains information about Actors based on this Blueprint, such as whether they can be damaged. Note that for Level Blueprints, only the **Tags** properties are relevant in this section. |


[REGION:note]
If you create custom categories for variables, the **Class Defaults** tab will display those categories too, after the Blueprint is compiled.

## Download Unreal Engine 4

We distribute Unreal Engine 4 to licensees via the _UE4-QA_ branch in the Perforce depot. This contains the entire 
engine along with several additional projects in the form of example games, samples, and demos. You have the option 
of downloading everything or picking and choosing only the parts you want or need. In order to get set up as quickly 
as possible, we recommend you only download the bare minimum to start with and then download other parts on an as-needed 
basis. This can dramatically reduce idle time spent waiting for the download to finish.

[REGION:warning]
	There are a large number of files in the _UE4-QA_ branch and the total download size is many gigabytes so the 
	download can take quite a while when syncing the entire branch.

1.	**Right-click** on the _UE4-QA_ branch and choose **Get Revision**.

1.	Press **Get Revision** to begin downloading Unreal Engine 4.

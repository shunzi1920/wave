1. Connect your device.
1.	Device driver software may automatically install, but if not, visit [Android's OEM USB Drivers](http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html) page to find driver installation links and additional information.  
1.	Open the **Settings** application on your device.
1.	Look for the **Developer Options** menu. If it is not available, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. For more about developer options, visit [Android's Using Hardware Devices](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html) page.
	1.	Scroll down and select **About Phone**. Depending on your Android device, you may have an **About Device**, **About Tablet**, or **About Shield** option instead.
		[REGION: note]
		Note: This may be in a **More** section on newer Android versions.

	1.	Tap the **Build Number** 7 times. After the first few presses, you will see a message stating You are now # steps away from becoming a developer.
	1.	You will get a success message once **Developer Mode** has been activated.
	1.	Navigate back to the **Settings** menu and select **Developer Options** which is now available.
1.	In the **Developer Options** menu, enable USB debugging. 
1. Select **OK** when prompted.
1.	To verify that your device is set up properly, open a command prompt by pressing **Windows+R** and typing `cmd.exe` in the **Run** window.
1.	Type `adb devices` in the command window. You should see a device listed. Some troubleshooting points here are:
	* If the device is listed but shows unauthorized, that indicates that you need to get the device to ask if you want to authorize the PC.
	* You may need to unplug and reconnect your device to make it show up.
	* It is recommended you check the Always allow checkbox.
	* In some cases, a correctly configured device may not show up if it is connected as a **Media Device (MTP)** instead of as a **Camera (PTP)**. Select the **Camera (PTP)** option if your device is not visible at all under `adb devices` at this point.

Using what you have learned, try to do the following:

* Create an **Actor** that moves or rotates to a target transform when an **Event** is run. This could be used as a moving platform or door in a game. Make the **Event** start a **Timer** that will trigger a second **Event** which moves the **Actor** back to its original location. Use exposed variables (via **UPROPERTY**) instead of hard-coded values wherever appropriate.
* Make a lit torch that burns out (perhaps by deactivating a fiery **Particle System Component**) by using a **Timer** handle and a few custom **Events**. For example, an _AddFuel_ **Event** could extend the burning time of the torch. A _DouseWithWater_ **Event** could shut it off immediately and prevent _AddFuel_ from working in the future. Both of these features can be written without using a **Tick**, simply by modifying a running **Timer** through its handle.

As for the specifics covered in this tutorial:

* For more information about **Timers**, try the [%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Timers:title%](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Timers) page.
* For a complete reference using the **UPROPERTY** tag with variables in your classes or structs, look at the [%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Properties:title%](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Properties) page.
* To learn more about **UFUNCTIONS** and **Event** creation, check the [%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Functions:title%](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Functions) page.
* For further tutorials, see the [%Programming/Tutorials:title%](Programming/Tutorials) page.

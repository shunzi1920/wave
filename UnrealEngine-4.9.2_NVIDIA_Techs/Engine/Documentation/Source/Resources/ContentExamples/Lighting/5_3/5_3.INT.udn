This example demonstrates the use of **Source Length** on reflective surfaces. The purpose of Source Length is to give lights an elongated or tube-like reflective shape, as if the light were coming form a fluorescent light fixture. It should be noted that light emission is still calculated as if it is coming from a single point. The effect exists only within reflections.

The Source Length runs down the Y-Axis of the light, and can be rotated by rotating the light. Also, while the light is selected, Source Length can be visualized by a yellow line stretching out from the light itself.

This example shows how indirect lighting can affect objects in the scene. Here we have a red light enclosed in a small space, with bounced light from the wall striking a static object and a dynamic one. Because indirect lighting is pre-calculated and baked into the static Lightmap, the static object's lighting and shadowing will be more accurate. For the dynamic object, however, lighting is dependent on the indirect lighting cache.

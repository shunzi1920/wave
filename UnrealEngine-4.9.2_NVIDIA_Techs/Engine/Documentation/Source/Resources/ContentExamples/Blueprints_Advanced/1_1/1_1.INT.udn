## Overview

The **BP_Random_Meshes** _Blueprint_ uses the Construction Script to randomly scatter _StaticMeshes_ within a radius, using exposed variables to allow users to customize the scale, rotation, and spacing of the _StaticMeshes_. All of the _StaticMeshes_ are actually components within the **BP_Random_Meshes** _Blueprint_.

*	A **ForLoop** node is used to repeat a section of script a specified number of times. In this case, the **Number of meshes** variable is also the number of times the **ForLoop** will repeat, adding a new _StaticMeshComponent_ each time.
*	**RandomFloatInRange** nodes are used to randomize the location, scale, and rotation of the _StaticMeshComponents_, as well as the _StaticMesh_ assets being used.
*	An array is used to allow the user to specify a list of possible _StaticMeshes_ that will be set for the _StaticMeshComponents_ in the Blueprint. After each _StaticMeshComponent_ is added, a _StaticMesh_ asset is picked from the array using a random index number and assigned to the newly added  _StaticMeshComponent_.

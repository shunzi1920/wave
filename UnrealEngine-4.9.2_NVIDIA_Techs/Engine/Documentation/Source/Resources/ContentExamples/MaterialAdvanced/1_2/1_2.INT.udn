Material Functions are basically fragments of a node graph they are like functions in a programming language or functions in blueprint. They output a value what kind of value it outputs depends on the graph. It can be anything from a scalar to vector or a texture sample. In this case, it is an entire Material.

Left example is a normal Material and the right is the exact same material but done with a Material function. The check flag use Material attributes in the Material Properties needs to be enabled.

Just by itself the Material Function work flow does not make much sense and it appears to be more complex. But the advantage is shown in the next example.

This example demonstrates the changing of a brush's shape with Edit mode. By clicking on the Edit button, you get access to a variety of tools and actions you can perform on a BSP brush, effectively allowing you to treat it like a 3D model that can be reshaped. However, it is important not to get too carried away - BSP surfaces are still not as efficient as Static Meshes. If you can find some application that will create models you can export out in FBX, you will generally be well advised to use that instead.

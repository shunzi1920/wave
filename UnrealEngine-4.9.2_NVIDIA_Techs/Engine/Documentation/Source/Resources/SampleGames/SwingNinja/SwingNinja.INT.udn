**Swing Ninja** is a simplified demo sample game in which the player controls a ninja character who uses a grappling rope to sling himself around the level, collecting coins. The game was constructed entirely with Blueprint visual scripting and developed by a single artist, instead of a programmer. The goal of the project was to produce a simplified proof of concept game with a focus on small team development for mobile platforms.

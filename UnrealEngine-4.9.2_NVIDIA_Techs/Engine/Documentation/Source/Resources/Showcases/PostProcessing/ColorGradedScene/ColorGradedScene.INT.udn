This next series of shots is actually rather similar to the Black and White sequence, the key difference being that the actual desaturation effect - coming from the same Color Grading Lookup Texture - is only applied by a factor of 50%. This means we are effectively dropping only half the color data from the original scene.

You can see the difference by tweaking the **Color Grading Intensity** values while looking through **CameraActor2**.

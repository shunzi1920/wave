Description:An overview of how to use Matinee to deconstruct the animated post process effects in the Post Process Matinee example included with UE4.



If you want to really pick apart the various settings used to make this scene work, it is best to view them while using Matinee. In this way, you can select a camera using the World Outliner, then scrub the timeline and watch the values animate throughout the scene, which can go a long way toward helping you see what is really happening. Use the following steps to access the Matinee sequence for this scene:

1. Click the ![](button_Matinee.png) button.

1. In the dropdown that appears, click the _Matinee Actor_ option.

1. Matinee will open. You may click the ![](button_Play.png) button to play through the animation, or drag the time slider along the bottom of the Matinee window for scrubbing. As you do so, you will see the animation move in the main viewport. Keep an eye on the main interface's **Details** panel, which shows all of the properties that are available. You can see these move and change both during playback and while scrubbing.

1. On any animated track, you can click the small ![](button_SendToCurveEditor.png) button and send the keyframes up to the Curve Editor, where you can see a graph of how the property changes over time. Monitoring this animation graph while watching playback can be very useful when deconstructing animated sequences.

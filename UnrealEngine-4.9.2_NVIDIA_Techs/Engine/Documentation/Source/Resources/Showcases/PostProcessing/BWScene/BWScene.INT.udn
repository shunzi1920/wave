One of the first extreme uses of post process in the scene is the use of _Color Grading_ to make the scene black and white. In this case, a grayscale lookup texture (LUT) was used to carefully drive the various hues toward black or white. The _Scene Fringe_ property has also been boosted during this scene.

Below you can see a direct comparison of the default LUT vs. the one that was used to create this effect:

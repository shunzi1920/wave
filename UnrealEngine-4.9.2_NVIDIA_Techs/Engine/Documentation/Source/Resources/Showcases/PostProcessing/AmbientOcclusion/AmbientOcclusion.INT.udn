Ambient occlusion simulates the natural darkening of crevices and indentations along a surface.

It is used as follows in this scene:

| **Property** | **Use in this scene** | **Before/After** |
|---|---|:---:|
| **Static Fraction** | A value of 0.7 (70%) is used to _pull back_ the amount of AO applied to the scene from static lighting, thus giving the look of light bouncing back up onto the character. <br><br> It should be noted that this works hand-in-hand with the Global Illumination settings to create the final effect.<br><br>More information about Ambient Occlusion settings can be found in the [Ambient Occlusion section of the Post Process Effects documentation](Engine/Rendering\LightingAndShadows\AmbientOcclusion).  | [INCLUDE:#AO] |

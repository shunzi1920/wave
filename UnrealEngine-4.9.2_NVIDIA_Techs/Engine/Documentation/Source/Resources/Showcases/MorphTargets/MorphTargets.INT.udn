This example showcases UE4's ability to have Skeletal Mesh Morph Targets that can animate during gameplay. In the level, we have a still life arrangement of fruit on a table. Depth of field is applied to the camera by way of a Post Process Volume. When you play the level, a Matinee sequence starts playing. This takes over the camera and shows an artistic shot of the table. A time-lapse is simulated in which the fruit begins to rot away and the scene desaturates.


## Scene Breakdown

Each of the pieces of fruit has a morph target that allows it to blend to a rotted shape. In conjunction, each piece also has a Material Instance applied to it in which the Material animates to a rotted version. When animated together, each piece convincingly rots away.

In this level, we use Level Blueprint to launch a Matinee sequence that animates each one of the fruit Skeletal Meshes and their corresponding Material Instances simultaneously. The flow works something like this:

## Creating Morph Targets

Morph targets are created within digital content creation (DCC) applications such as 3ds Max, Maya, and others. In Max, they share the same name of "Morph Targets," and are created via the Morpher Modifier. In Maya, they are known as Blend Shapes.

More information on the creation of Morph Targets and importing them into Unreal can be found in the [Morph Target documentation](Engine/Content\FBX\MorphTargets).


## Morph Target Previewing

Morph Targets are applied to Skeletal Meshes and can be previewed within Persona. By **double-clicking** a morphing Skeletal Mesh, it will open in Persona. By default, if you enter _Mesh Edit Mode_ by clicking the Mesh button at the top, you will see the Morph Target Previewer at the lower-right corner of the window.

By selecting an AnimSequence associated with the morphing mesh asset, you can drag the slider left and right and watch the transition between the morphed state and the original state.



## Animating Morph Targets

When you create a Morph Target in your external DCC application, it can be imported into Unreal and animated from within the editor. However, there are some considerations with doing this. Foremost is that animation of a Morph Target **must** occur as part of an existing AnimSequence. Morphs are now thought of as a part of an AnimSequence and do not have their own visible asset in the **Content Browser**. Because of this, it is recommended that you handle the animation of your Morph Targets in your 3D application and then import that animation along with your Skeletal Mesh.

To do this, follow these steps **after** you have created _and animated_ your Morph Target in your 3D package, and exported it via FBX:

1. In the **Content Browser**, click the ![](button_NewCB.png) button and choose _Import to..._
1. Use the following settings:

	![](ImportSettings_MorphTargets.png)
	* If your asset does not currently have a Skeleton that exists in UE4, make sure you choose _None_ for the Skeleton option.
	* Check _Import Morph Targets_.
	* Check _Import Animation_ and provide a name for the AnimSequence.
1. Click ![](button_Import.png). The resulting AnimSequence contains your Morph data as it was animated in your 3D package.



At this point, you are essentially done and the animation of your Morph Target has been imported. When you cue the animation (via a Matinee Anim Track or any other mechanism), the transition of the Morph Target will play. 


### Viewing/Editing Morph Target Animation

If you would like to see the Morph Target transition data for yourself and perhaps make changes to it, here is how to go about it.

1. **Double-click** the AnimSequence. This will open it in Persona.

1. In the Curves area (located at bottom center of Persona), click the ![](button_downArrow.png) button shown below. You should see a track in the context menu named for your Morph Target:
	
	![](PersonaCurveArea.png) ![](MorphTargetCurveContextMenu.png)
1. Check the checkbox next to the Morph Target name and click **Refresh**. The curve for the animated Morph Target will then appear.

1. You may **Shift-click** on the curve to add new keyframes and tweak their tangent handles to change the way the transition takes place.

[REGION:note]
You may have noticed that the Morph Target curve was hidden by default. This is by design; in many instances - particularly facial animation - there will be many Morph Target curves available, many with complex animation. Showing all of those at the same time is not performant.
[/REGION]

### Adding Your Own Morph Target Animation

If you want to add your own Morph Target animation to an existing AnimSequence, this is done like so:

1. Open the desired AnimSequence to which you would like to add Morph Target animation by **double-clicking** it. This will open Persona.
	![](AppleAnimationNoCurve.png)(w:600)
1. In the Curve area (mid center), click the ![](button_AddFloatTrack.png) button and enter the name of an existing Morph Target that is a part of the Static Mesh. When you press Enter, a new track will be created.

	![](NewTrackName.png)
	![](MorphTargetCurves.png)
1.  Click the  button at the far right of the track and check _Morph Curve_.

	![](AddMorphCurve.png)
1. Any changes you make to the curve, such as adding keyframes (**Shift-click**) will now affect the animation of the Morph Target.




## Matinee Sequence 

The Matinee sequence in use in this scene is fairly straightforward. A Director Track gives a fade in and fade out. Each piece of fruit has its own group, each group containing an Anim Track (which animates the Morph Target) and a Material Parameter Track, which animates the Material Instance. There is also some animation on the post process color settings of the camera, creating some desaturation as the effect takes place. This Matinee sequence is launched by the Level Blueprint.
